# PEMS-final-year-project-
PEMS Stands for Penta Element monitoring system designed for cultivation purpose.Main objective of the project is to analyse the nature elements by using array of sensors. To increase the quality of crops. Since it is Beginner friendly , PEMS makes users to cultivate quality crops and understand how nature helps in cultivation. This project is the implementation of IoT in cultivation. The  sensor used are rain detection sensor, soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor,  temperature sensor, air flow sensors.


**ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT**
 
 
IoT is to connect the unconnected. It is a transition technology in 
which devices will allow us to sense and control the physical world through an 
Intelligent network. This project is the implementation of IoT in cultivation. The 
sensor used are rain detection sensor, soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, 
temperature sensor, air flow sensors. The proposed model makes the work user 
friendly to farmers and beginners who are all interested in cultivation(planting)in
smart way. The cost effective model is a simple architecture that detects the five 
elements of nature and send it to the Wi-Fi over the sensor and the following 
details can be displayed on the smart device

**Proposed system**

Proposed system used only one technology which is Wi Fi for five sensor which specifies five elements of nature.System may decrease the cost value of the model. 
Since the system is Beginner Friendly, every user can use this for planting or cultivation.This system consists soil moisture sensor for sensing the moisture 
content of the soil,rain detection sensor for detecting the rain,temperature sensor for sensing the temperature of the atmosphere,humidity sensors for sensing the humidity of the atmosphere,air flow sensor for detecting the air flow of the area. The data that collected will give the clear outcome of crop to planted.All these 
sensors are interfaced with NodeMCU which has inbuilt wifi. With the help of wireless communication, the data is upload to the ThingSpeak cloud platform at a 
regular interval of seconds.

**Architecture Explanation**

The proposed system consist of Penta Element Monitoring System for Cultivation. These system can be accessed by using an IOT device NODE-MCU ESP8266 microcontroller. The PEMS model can be accessed by NODE-MCU ESP8266 and the program can be upload in board using Arduino IDE software. This system consists of five types of sensors i.e. soil 
moisture sensor,air flow detection sensor,temperaturesensor,humiditysensor and rain detection sensor .These sensors are used to detect the five types of nature elements. The detected value can be monitored on the desktopthrough Wi-Fi network. The tool used to display the result value is ThingSpeak.In these advanced PEMS MODEL SYSTEM is achieved. Along with the PEMS model sensor can be attached.Forfuthurpredictation of results,The final collected datasets is compiled through Weka software with number of algorithms for accurate output.Algorithms like Decision Tree,Random Forest etc .In this algorithms which produces Prediction data at faster rate is user for final data output.


**Conclusion**

The Penta Element Monitoring System for Cultivation has been developed by using multiple future of sensor components in IOT. PEMS model is achieved by ThingSpeak IoT platform to get a wavelength of the detected values. Itâ€™s a efficient way to understand the awareness about natural properties of the land. Then , the accurate value of the dataset collection can be done by Weka 3.9.5 software by using different algorithms like data preprocess, classify, cluster, select attributes. Finally, the detected value can be displayed on the desktop via WiFi network.
